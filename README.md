# vi-rover.js
---


After going through the Awsome Nodebots / [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) we had a working rover. The rover only moved forward and then stopped, so we were left to play.


I decided to combine my new favorite thing (johnny-five/nodebots) and my oldest favorite thing "VI"


### Steps to use

1. Build a rover! 
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/cybo42/vim-rover`
3. Install dependencies `$ npm install`
4. Start vi-rover.js `$ node vi-rover.js`
5. Enjoy!!

When After you start up you will see the below prompt, in case you forgot your vi keymappings

```
vi-rover ready!
  j = forward
  k = reverse
  h = left
  l = right
  space = stop


Control-C to exit
```
